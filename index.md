# A new version is coming

Sorry for putting this website off for so long. I have been busy playing Stepford County Railway, and I haven't really focused that much on other projects.

I also had to move between my Erith and Gravesend HQ constantly, due to issues I dont want to get into.

But here is the good news! In a few weeks, a new website design will hit this site. Once again, sorry for putting this off for so long. 

The new version will be based off an old version of LKG, and will have all of it's functions. 

Until then, stick around, and have a good day!
